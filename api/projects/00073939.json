The basic approach of the Project will be to promote renewable energy in Bangladesh through the recently established Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA). For Bangladesh to achieve a greater share of renewable energy (RE) in its energy mix, the Project will support activities that will (i) transform SREDA into a strong RE project facilitation center to bring confidence to private RE investors and increase the number of approved RE projects; (ii) increase the capacities of appropriate government agencies to generate, process, obtain and disseminate reliable RE resource information for use by potential project developers and investors; (iii) increase the affordability of photo-voltaic solar lanterns (PVSLs) for low income households by supporting pilot PVSL diffusion activities; and (iv) increase the share of RE in Bangladesh's power mix through facilitating the financing, implementation and operation of pilot (RE) energy projects using rice husk and solar panels. The lessons learned from the pilot plants will be utilized to scale-up the dissemination of PVSLs and investment in on-grid RE projects and RE technologies.","output_id":"00086516","output_title":"Development of Sustainable Ren"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00073939","project_title":"Development of Sustainable Renewable Energy Power Genera","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2014-01-01","subnational":[]}
