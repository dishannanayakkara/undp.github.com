The project represents a merger between a UNDP-KWS concept and a UNEP-MWCT concept. The rationale behind the project stems from the persistent tension between conservation and development in the greater Amboseli ecosystem where the high returns from tourism have bypassed the local community. Additional pressure from growing populations, nationally and locally, has further heightened the fear of losing the remaining rangelands, given the inadequate security of tenure for group ranches. This has provided an incentive for subdividing group ranches, converting them into fenced cultivated land, at the expense of the ecosystem's ability to provide for both wildlife conservation and livelihoods.Against this backdrop, the Global Environment Facility approved a Project Preparatory Grant (PPG) of USD 100,000 for preparation of a Project Document.","output_id":"00083089","output_title":"4KEN12402: Southern Rangeland"}],"project_descr":"4KEN12402: PIMS 4626: PPG Enhancing Wildlife Conservation in the Productive Southern Kenya Rangelands through a landscape approach.","project_id":"00067172","project_title":"4KEN12402: PIMS 4490: PPG Enhancing Wildlife Conservat","region_id":"RBA","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00067172","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"1","lon":"38","name":"Kenya","outputID":"00083089","output_locID":"00083089-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
