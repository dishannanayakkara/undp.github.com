Effective mainstreaming of drylands issues into development frameworks leading to budgetary allocation for implementing livelihoods options on the ground; advocacy, awareness creation and policy dialogue at national and sub-national levels.\n\n2.   Improve living standards for rural communities living in the drylands through strengthening the rural economy and creating and implementing livelihood opportunities; lessons learnt from these will inform policy processes.\n\n3.
