The Quartet reaffirms its objective to promote an end to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in conformity with the Road Map, and expresses its intention to redouble its efforts in that regard.  The urgency of recent events has reinforced the need for the international community, bearing in mind the obligations of the parties, to help Palestinians as they build the institutions and economy of a viable State in Gaza and the West Bank, able to take its place as a peaceful and prosperous partner to Israel and its other neighbors. To facilitate efforts to these ends, following discussions among the principals, the Quartet announced the appointment of the Rt. Hon. Mr. Tony Blair (United Kingdom) as the Quartet Representative.\n\nExpected Project Output/Outcome:\nContinue to provide operational and logistical support to OQR during its mandate until Jan 2011.
