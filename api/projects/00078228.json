Each labour-intensive construction site will mobilize between 169 and 360 male and female workers, over periods of 120 to 270 days, depending on the site. The total number of workers that will be mobilized by the project is estimated at 528, at least 30% of them women. The project will benefit indirectly about 2,112 individuals, considering an average household size of 4 members in Guinea-Bissau. In addition, the project will yield social benefits resulting from improved quality of sanitation in the beneficiary regions.\nThe project will adopt a Direct Implementation Modality (DIM) and will have two implementing partners, namely ADPP (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Ajuda de Desenvolvimento de Povo para Povo) and AGEOPPE (Ag\u00eancia Guineense de Execu\u00e7\u00e3o de Obras de Interesse P\u00fablico e Promo\u00e7\u00e3o de Emprego). Both implementing partners are regional agencies with extensive experience in the implementation of LI projects.","output_id":"00088609","output_title":"Labor-intensive employment for"}],"project_descr":"HIMO pour la cr\u00e9ation d'empoi pour les jeunes.","project_id":"00078228","project_title":"Labor-intensive employment for youth and women","region_id":"RBA","start":"2014-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00078228","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"12","lon":"-15","name":"Guinea-Bissau","outputID":"00088609","output_locID":"00088609-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
