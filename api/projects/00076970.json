The country contains well over 350 wetlands, which cover close to 7% of the national territory, approximately 30% of which are formally protected and 12 of which have been declared internationally important by the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar sites) based on their importance for conserving biodiversity. \nThe project will yield substantial global environmental benefits by increasing the conservation and sustainable use of eleven (11) IIPW. The GEF alternative will increase wetland ecosystem representation within the national PA system by protecting an additional 12,063 hectares of critical wetlands. Additionally, the project will improve the management effectiveness of seven (7) IIPW covering 210,089 hectares through the following means: a) implementation of protection and control plans; b) physical demarcation of IIPW boundaries and ecologically sensitive wetland areas; c) implementation of a wetland ecological monitoring system that will use a set of indicators to track the conditions of key species and ecosystems and will guide decision-making and long-term planning; d) development of a local management program for seven (7) IIPW that will increase public awareness about the importance of wetlands and will promote stakeholder participation in IIPW planning and management; and e) strengthening skills of IIPW administrative staff in PA management, implementing measures for wetland conservation, and mitigating impacts to biodiversity in IIPW, including impacts from invasive species and climate change","output_id":"00088054","output_title":"Wetlands - conservation, susta"}],"project_descr":"Conservation, sustainable use of biodiversity, and maintenance of ecosystem services of internationally important protected wetlands","project_id":"00076970","project_title":"Wetlands - Conservation, sustainable use of biodiversity","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2014-03-01","subnational":[]}
