The project will address barriers to sustainable pasture and forest management. In doing so it will support measures to mitigate CC such as managing natural forests to emphasize natural regeneration through improved grazing and wood collecting in forests. It will avoid GHG emissions caused by degradation, increase sequestration through enhanced biomass and improve the productivity of forests and pasturelands. This would result in short and long-term global benefits.","output_id":"00080444","output_title":"Sustainable Land and Forest Ma"}],"project_descr":"Sustainable land and forest management in the Greater Caucasus landscape","project_id":"00063140","project_title":"Sustainable Land and Forest Management in Greater Caucas","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00063140","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"40.3688","lon":"49.8211","name":"Baku","outputID":"00080444","output_locID":"00080444-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
