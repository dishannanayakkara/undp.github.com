Regional, sub-regional and national policies have the necessary analytical perspective and strategic planning tools to promote Human Development with special emphasis on the structural factors of inequality (Regional output); Output 1.3.  Solutions developed at national and sub-national levels for sustainable management of natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystem services (SP output 1.3); Output 1.4. Scaled up action on climate change adaptation and mitigation across sectors which is funded and implemented (SP output 1.4). This output will be focused on leveraging KM tools to map, analyze, systematize, and transfer experiences to maximize the impacts of the environment and energy portfolio of the RSC, with a focus on impacts of the EE unit on vulnerable groups, and by building capacities in the recipient countries for optimal use of environment related funds. This output seeks to take advantage of the experience, knowledge and capacities created or strengthened by the EE portfolio in the region, in order to maximize impacts for the benefits of vulnerable groups, and formulate new solutions and strategies aiming at increasing the development effectiveness of EE interventions that can be applied throughout the region. This output follows three \"regionality\" principles of the new RP: principle c) Advancement of awareness, dialogue and action on sensitive and/or emerging development issues that benefit strongly from multi-country experiences and perspectives; principle d) Promotion of experimentation and innovation that overcomes institutional, financial and/or informational barriers that may be too high for an individual country to surmount; and principle e) Generation and sharing of development knowledge, experience and expertise, for instance, through South-South and triangular cooperation, so that countries can connect to, and benefit from, relevant experiences from across the region and beyond.","output_id":"00089820","output_title":"Poverty & Environment Link"}],"project_descr":"Strategic Eco-systems and Biodiversity protected through the implementation of valuation methodologies, payment of environmental services and adoption of new technologies.","project_id":"00050457","project_title":"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT","region_id":"global","start":"2008-06-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00050457","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","outputID":"00062371","output_locID":"00062371-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00050457","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","outputID":"00062372","output_locID":"00062372-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00050457","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","outputID":"00062375","output_locID":"00062375-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00050457","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"8.9936","lon":"-79.51973","name":"Panama","outputID":"00089820","output_locID":"00089820-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
