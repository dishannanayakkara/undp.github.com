This revision reflects these recommendations and envisages two outputs for a project:\r\nOutput 1. Professionalism, efficiency, transparency and accountability of public administration improved through policy support and capacity development\r\nOutput 2. Internal operations of identified state institutions improved leading to strengthened policy development and implementation\r\nIn its revised version, CDF will continue provision of the capacity development assistance, linked to a broader set of reforms, including the design of an overall Public Administration Reform strategy. It will have a multi-sided focus on individual, organizational and national capacity and skills by supporting the drivers of empowerment, leadership, public participation and institutional change. It will also provide critical and immediate capacity development interventions in policy, management, leadership, and institutional reform.","output_id":"00076557","output_title":"Capacity Development Facility"}],"project_descr":"Capacity Development Framework","project_id":"00060705","project_title":"Capacity Development Facility","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2010-10-11","subnational":[{"awardID":"00060705","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"42.87","lon":"74.59","name":"Bishkek","outputID":"00076557","output_locID":"00076557-1","precision":"1","type":"PPLC"}]}
