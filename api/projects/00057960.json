Capacity constraints are serious impediments to the design and implementation of gender-responsive growth-oriented poverty reducing policies and programmes at regional, national and sub-national levels, as well as to the quest of African countries to promote regional integration, peace & security and good governance. This regional project aims to contribute to addressing these challenges by enhancing the capacities of African institutions to promote Pro-Poor Growth and Accountability. Specifically, it seeks to contribute to tackling critical/strategic capacity gaps/priorities of regional significance/dimensions through the design and implementation of selected \"flagship\" capacity development programmes. In this regard, the project will provide support to strengthening institutional capacities of, and to promoting regional partnerships with the AUC and four RECs (CEMAC, COMESA, ECOWAS and IGAD) as well as with the MRU, in order to provide sustained CD services at national and regional levels.  The project will facilitate strengthened African ownership and leadership of capacity development initiatives. Further, the project will improve the way capacity development interventions are conceptualized, designed, implemented, monitored and evaluated in UNDP country programmes, as well as those of other partners, including UNCTs.
