The overall objective of the RAHA programme is to support the Government of Pakistan's pro-poor development efforts to bring the poor communities in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa into the mainstream of development by improving access to, and reducing existing inequalities in resources, incomes and livelihood opportunities. The specific objective is to improve livelihoods, rehabilitate the\nenvironment and enhance social cohesion within communities of refugee/IDP affected and hosting areas. In addition, as the IDPs situation demands, the action will also facilitate the return of IDPs by creating absorption capacity through small scale community-based reintegration
