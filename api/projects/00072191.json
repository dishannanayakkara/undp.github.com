The project has three inter-related major outputs: a) conducting inventory of the pasture areas in Ismayilli to obtain a clear picture on soil/vegetation/carbon conditions; b) preparation and application of sustainable land management models across 3,000 ha of selected pasture land (including rehabilitation and restoration works); c) design and application of carbon flow monitoring mechanism to assess changes in carbon sequestration/absorption and avoided CO2 emissions overtime. All components have built-in capacity building elements targeting local government representatives responsible for land management and agricultural policy, farmers and communities, as well as civil servants in the field of environment.","output_id":"00085357","output_title":"Clima East pilot project"}],"project_descr":"Clima East: Supporting Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Neighbourhood East and Russia (Clima East Pilots Project)","project_id":"00072191","project_title":"Clima East pilot projects on ecosystem-based approaches","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00072191","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"40.3688","lon":"49.8211","name":"Baku","outputID":"00085357","output_locID":"00085357-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
