The programme will strengthen capacity for strategic planning, management and monitoring of governance reform for more effective, accountable and transparent delivery of services. The design proposes five interrelated outputs to realise this outcome. Output one will strengthen policy development, strategic oversight and monitoring of governance reform. Output two will improve organisational and systems development for more effective, accountable and transparent services. Output three will strengthen Human Resource Management and Human Resource Development policies, procedures and capacity, and establish a cost effective and sustainable system for civil service training and development to strengthen service delivery performance. Output four will strengthen fiscal decentralization, devolved planning and financial management for improved service delivery for the poor. Output five will focus on supporting demand-driven governance reforms at Central and local levels which directly impact on service delivery. The proposed timeframe for the programme is four years to 2010 to obtain alignment with the Government's timeframe (NSEDP).","output_id":"00056568","output_title":"GPAR Support for Better Servic"}],"project_descr":"Governance and Public Administration Reform: Support for Better Service Delivery Programme was designed to strengthen capacity for strategic planning, financing, management and monitoring of governance reform.","project_id":"00047224","project_title":"GPAR Support for Better Service Delivery","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2007-06-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00047224","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"20.5","lon":"104","name":"Houaphan","outputID":"00056568","output_locID":"00056568-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00047224","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"19.45","lon":"103.158","name":"Khouang","outputID":"00056568","output_locID":"00056568-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00047224","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"15.68333","lon":"106.43333","name":"Saravane","outputID":"00056568","output_locID":"00056568-3","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00047224","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"15.5","lon":"107","name":"Sekong","outputID":"00056568","output_locID":"00056568-4","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00047224","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"19.45","lon":"103.158","name":"Xieng","outputID":"00056568","output_locID":"00056568-5","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
