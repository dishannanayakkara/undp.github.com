The project will be implemented in two of the poorest governorates (Fayoum and Sohag), since youth unemployment has a significant rural dimension and since 62% of Egyptian youth live in rural areas. The project will further integrate LED methodologies and tools, which will ensure alignment with the local economic potential and context in the pilot governorates and will result in better targeting of interventions promoting investment and ensuring social equality.","output_id":"00085907","output_title":"Innovative Public Works II"},{"award_id":"00049150","budget":[5000000.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00141"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN"],"donor_short":["JPN"],"expenditure":[0.0],"fiscal_year":["2014"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":null,"output_id":"00089712","output_title":"Public Works Phase III"},{"award_id":"00049150","budget":[1000.0],"crs":"15110","crs_descr":"Economic and development policy/planning","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[0.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"Small Enterprise Access to Financial Services Increased","output_id":"00059736","output_title":"Increased Access to Finance"},{"award_id":"00049150","budget":[41000.0],"crs":"15110","crs_descr":"Economic and development policy/planning","donor_id":[""],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT"],"donor_short":[],"expenditure":[0.0],"fiscal_year":["2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"None","gender_id":"0","output_descr":"Micro-enterprises and income generating activities promoted.","output_id":"00059739","output_title":"Micro Enterprises Promoted"}],"project_descr":"The SFD is mandated to participate in the government efforts to address unemployment by promoting MSEs development","project_id":"00049150","project_title":"Social Fund for Development - Phase IV","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2008-01-20","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049150","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"30.06263","lon":"31.24967","name":"Egypt","outputID":"00059735","output_locID":"00059735-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00049150","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"30.06263","lon":"31.24967","name":"Egypt","outputID":"00085239","output_locID":"00085239-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00049150","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"30.06263","lon":"31.24967","name":"Egypt","outputID":"00085242","output_locID":"00085242-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00049150","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"30.06263","lon":"31.24967","name":"Egypt","outputID":"00085243","output_locID":"00085243-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00049150","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"30.06263","lon":"31.24967","name":"Egypt","outputID":"00085907","output_locID":"00085907-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
