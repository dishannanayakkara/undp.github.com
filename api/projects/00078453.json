This project has been conceived as a follow-up of the Area Development Programme in Balochistan (ADPB) which has been ongoing since 1996 under a NIM modality with the Government of Balochistan. Based on the successful results of the ADPB in terms of poverty reduction and community participation, an evaluation was carried out to analyse progress to date and to make recommendations for a more targeted programme to be implemented from January 2014. Based on these recommendations and on extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including the Government of Balochistan, the PC-1 document for the LED-B programme has been developed and shared with the Government.  The final version is now being revised and after endorsement by the GoB will be sent to the ECNEC for approval which can take some months. UNDP has developed this PIP in order to support the finalization of the PC-1, accompany the approval process and particularly to ensure baseline information and analysis of selection criteria for the geographical focus of the LED-B.","output_id":"00088713","output_title":"Local Economic Development Bal"}],"project_descr":"Project will help to increase income level of the most vulnerable households through value chain development and addressing policy, institutional and capacity constraints to business development.","project_id":"00078453","project_title":"Local Economic Development Balochistan","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2013-12-30","subnational":[{"awardID":"00078453","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"30.199","lon":"67.00971","name":"Balochistan","outputID":"00088713","output_locID":"00088713-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
