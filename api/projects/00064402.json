During the launch phase the objective was to primarily build strong partnerships at the national, regional and global levels (especially between UNDP and UNCDF), and to make a case for increased investments at the local level.   Beyond the launching phase, based on the lessons learned and project board decision to revise the title and focus of the programme, for the 2011-2014 period, this initiative will focus on a) strengthening the knowledge base and south- south cooperation for local development;  b) providing strategic policy advisory services to country programmes in support of scaling-up local development innovations; c) building strong partnerships with all development partners and stakeholders within and outside the UN, such as the UN agencies working at the local level, decentralized cooperation partners, civil society organizations, academia, and bilateral and multilateral banks.","output_id":"00080053","output_title":"Scaling Up Local Innovations"}],"project_descr":"Scaling Up Integrated Local Development Innovations","project_id":"00064402","project_title":"Scaling Up Integrated Local Development Innovations","region_id":"global","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00064402","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00080053","output_locID":"00080053-1","precision":"","type":""}]}
