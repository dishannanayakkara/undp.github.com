Mean sea levels are expected to rise, wave climates are likely to alter ; and the frequency and intensity of storms are projected to change. More than 60% of the population lives in coastal areas either in urban or rural settings, placing significant pressure on coastal resources and natural capital. Ecosystem services, for example, those provided by mangrove swamps, dune systems and coral reefs, are critical in providing resilience against SLR and destructive maritime hazards (storm surges, tsunamis and tropical cyclones). \r\n\r\nThe project will tackle barriers in relation to weak inter-sectoral policy coordination and development, low institutional and individual capacity to plan for climate change, and financial constraints.. The project has two Outcomes relating to the development of adaptive capacity to manage the effects of climate change on coastal resources. The project will support the development of human, social, natural, physical and financial capitals to enable communities and government to continue the results delivered with this project grant.","output_id":"00079862","output_title":"Adaptation in the Coastal Zone"}],"project_descr":"The project has 2 Outcomes relating to the development of adaptive capacity to manage the effects of climate change on coastal resources.
