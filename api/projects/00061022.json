The CCBA programme will be implemented under the existing established UNDP/GEF/SGP implementation infrastructure. The CCBA has three programme components: (1) improved necessary capacity within NGOs, CBOs and local communities to implement community adaptation measures; (2) mainstreamed adaptation to climate
