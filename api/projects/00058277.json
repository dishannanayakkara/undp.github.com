That sewage pumping station will pump periodically the accumulated influx of sewage from the Park through a proposed 680 meters 6 inch-diameter steel pipe to the central Jerichowastewater treatment plant.\n\n2.Construction of electricity transmission line in the West Bank:The proposed component aims at supporting the power supply to the Jericho Agro-Industrial Park through the construction of an underground 33 kV transmission lineof approximately 4 Km long extending from theJerusalem District Electricity Company (JDECO)Dead Sea Power Station to the Industrial Park Power Substation.\n\n3.Construction of Shallow water well(s) in the Jordan valley: The proposed component aims at completing the system water provision to the JAIP.  A shallow water well will be constructed to feed into the existing water connection system in order to ensure and stabilize water provision to the JAIP. The amount of municipal water provided by the existing elevated tank is 500M3 whilst the anticipated daily water need for the PARK is 1000M3. Hence, supplementary source of water will be through shallow well(s), which should yield 500M3. \n\n4.\tSupport of employment generation in the West Bank (Industrial hangar):the project will comprise the construction of one industrial hangar of approximately 8,000 square meters (up to funding availability) to provide additional space and logistical support for future tenants. The hangar will be in addition to the one that is under construction by JAIP, and it will besupplied with all needed services such as water and electricity.","output_id":"00089721","output_title":"Support to Industrial Services"},{"award_id":"00058277","budget":[64200.0,520806.0,306633.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00141"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN"],"donor_short":["JPN"],"expenditure":[18526.0,516730.0,306798.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Extension of a Water Network to Service Jericho Southern Area Mainly the Future Jericho Agro-Industrial Park (JAIP)","output_id":"00078092","output_title":"Water Network Extension JAIP"},{"award_id":"00058277","budget":[112203.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00141"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN"],"donor_short":["JPN"],"expenditure":[110747.0],"fiscal_year":["2012"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"As part of the Governemnt of Japan, \"Corrdidor for peace and Prosperity\" initiative, a feasability study was undertaken by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the Development of a Agro-Industrial Park in the Jordan River Rift Valley.
