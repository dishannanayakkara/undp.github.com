Sustaining the region's economic growth will be made more difficult, and existing development challenges are already being exacerbated due to the region's low adaptive capacity and high social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. As a result, climate change brings huge economic costs to Africa, on top of existing poverty reduction and development needs. Climate resilience for food security has been identified as one of the most urgent priorities for climate change adaptation in Africa. While various adaptation initiatives including the Africa Adaptation Programme have helped countries in the region to integrate climate adaptation issues into development plans and measures, critical capacity gaps remain in many African countries to effectively address complex climate change adaptation challenges across different sectors. This project aims to enhance the capacity of African countries to adapt to current and projected impacts of climate variability and change that affect food security and other development priorities, by strengthening climate risk management and pursuing climate-resilient development paths. More specifically, this project will provide targeted support to the following areas: 1) improving climate information systems for informed decision-making and integrated planning approaches; 2) testing and scaling up climate risk management measures including weather index insurance and community based adaptation measures, while also enhancing the capacity to access and manage climate finance. This project will ensure maximum synergies with existing initiatives and partnership structures at country and regional levels. The project will be implemented in close consultation and coordination with UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States and central bureaux, donor partners, government counterparts, regional mechanisms, other UN agencies and relevant CSOs to leverage extensive knowledge and expertise to address the critical climate-related challenges in the region.","output_id":"00086998","output_title":"Output 4: Mozambique"},{"award_id":"00074692","budget":[643745.0,665000.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00141"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN"],"donor_short":["JPN"],"expenditure":[39950.0,21255.0],"fiscal_year":["2014","2013"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"This project aims to enhance the capacity of African countries to adapt to current and projected impacts of climate variability and change that affect food security and other development priorities.
