The UN Office for REDD+ Coordination in Indonesia (UNORCID) was established under a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the United Nations System and the Republic of Indonesia in September 2011. UNORCID has a comprehensive mandate to support the Government of Indonesia and numerous stakeholders in implementing Indonesia's REDD+ and related priorities. \r\nFollowing to this signing, the UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, ILO, UNOPS, UNODC and FAO have  joined as additional parties to the MoU.   While several other UN agencies are also actively considering their joining the MoU.  UNORCID has a finite life-span that, unless renewed by mutual agreement between the parties to the MoU, expires in September 2015. The UNORCID has its Head Office in Jakarta with Pilot Province Offices in Palangka Raya and Jambi.  The Government of Indonesia has requested the UNORCID to continue its support to the other 9 provinces as defined by the REDD+ Agency.\r\nThe UNORCID operation is supported with  resources committed from the UNDG Headquarter in New York and other UN Agencies, both through direct funding and in-kind support such as dedicated senior technical staf assigned in UNORCID. The Office has also obtained support from Norway until 31 December 2014.","output_id":"00086613","output_title":"United Nations Office for REDD"}],"project_descr":"United Nations for REDD+ Coordination in Indonesia","project_id":"00074047","project_title":"United Nations Office for REDD Coordination in Indonesia","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2013-05-16","subnational":[]}
