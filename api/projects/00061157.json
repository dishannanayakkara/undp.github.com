Given the cross-cutting scope of this sector, the project will therefore contribute to incorporate climate change issues into the planning processes and investment decisions of key line ministries. Targeted work in Tegucigalpa and the watersheds that provision the capital city, will validate concrete response measures  ranging from economic incentives to low-cost technology investments that will assist in orienting work at policy levels.","output_id":"00077360","output_title":"Addressing Climate Change Risk"}],"project_descr":"Honduras Addressing Climate Change Risk\non Water Resources in Honduras: Increased Systemic Resilience and Reduced Vulnerability of the Urban Poor","project_id":"00061157","project_title":"Addressing Climate Change on Water Resources","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2011-03-04","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061157","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"14.0818","lon":"-87.20681","name":"Francisco Morazan","outputID":"00077360","output_locID":"00077360-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
