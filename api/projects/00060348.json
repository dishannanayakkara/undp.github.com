The five year programme has five objectives:\r\n1.\tTo prevent HIV transmission among most-at-risk populations (IDUs, SWs, MSM, merchant marines, prisoners, Roma youth, general youth). Activities planned focus on outreach work (NEP, condom and lubricant distribution, rapid tests, counselling, distribution of IEC materials, etc.), drop in and counselling centres and peer education programmes. Sensitisation trainings are planned for key health and law enforcement professionals, police officers, prison staff and social workers with the aim of creating a more supportive environment for HIV prevention among vulnerable populations. Other trainings target physicians, nurses and dentists with the aim of enhancing HIV prevention and answering the particular health needs of the populations affected/targeted. Operation of the 8 existing Montenegrin VCT centres is planned to be improved through additional training, strengthened supervision and improved coordination. A modest component of the programme targets youth through institutionalization of Healthy Life Styles subject in secondary schools and maintaining of the quality approach to HLS subject implementation in primary schools. \r\n2.\tTo improve quality of care and support to PLHIV\r\nProgramme aims to improve care and support to PLHIV through several activities: training in ARV prescribing, provision of missing equipment for the Montenegrin Clinic for Infectious Diseases (procured in Jan 2011), training in provision of psychosocial support for staff of the Montenegrin infectious disease clinic who are in closest and most regular contact with PLHIV, provision of psychosocial and legal assistance to PLHIV, and through sensitization trainings implemented with the aim of creating a network of physicians, nurses and dentists willing and able to provide PLHIV with necessary medical services.\r\n3.\tTo create a supportive environment for HIV prevention and care  \r\nActivities include awareness campaigns targeted towards the general population. They focus on de-stigmatizing both PLHIV and equally important populations at risk such as MSM, IDU and SW. Activities implemented under a separate SDA are planned to introduce the gender sensitive approach to the health system, in particular through targeting GO and NGO staff contributing to the national response to the HIV epidemic, but also through training of journalists and addressing the general population through media. \r\n4.\tTo strengthen the HIV surveillance system among most-at-risk populations \r\nActivities are aimed at further enhancing the Montenegrin HIV M&E system with the aim of better understanding the epidemic in the country through regular bio-behavioral and behavioural surveys among most at risk groups.\r\n5.\tTo increase capacity and coordination of a focused response to HIV among most-at-risk populations\r\nThe round 9 program builds on Rd 5 achievements and aims to further contribute to empowering of     \r\nMontenegrin GOs and NGOs primarily to ensure sustainability of programs upon the completion of \r\nthe grant period. This approach is reflected in the proposal for UNDP to step down as the PR in year \r\n3 of the programme implementation, and to be succeeded by two PRs: one from the governmental \r\nsector (Institute of Public Health) and one from the non-governmental sector (NGO CAZAS).","output_id":"00075943","output_title":"Scale up HIV response in MNE"}],"project_descr":"Scale up of the national response to HIV/AIDS among most-at-risk populations in Montenegro","project_id":"00060348","project_title":"Scale up of HIV response to most at risk populat. in Mne","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2010-08-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.09306","lon":"19.10028","name":"Bar, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.8425","lon":"19.87333","name":"Berane, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"43.04472","lon":"19.74333","name":"Bijelo Polje, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-3","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.45306","lon":"18.5375","name":"Herceg Novi, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-4","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.43333","lon":"18.76667","name":"Kotor, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-5","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.79944","lon":"18.92028","name":"Niksic, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-6","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"43.33333","lon":"19.33333","name":"Pljevlja, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-7","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.44111","lon":"19.26361","name":"Podgorica, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-8","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00060348","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"42.43639","lon":"18.69611","name":"Tivat, Montenegro","outputID":"00075943","output_locID":"00075943-9","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
