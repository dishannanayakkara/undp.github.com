It has worked with all the key institutions: the Courts, Prosecution, Public Defenders, the Ministry of Justice (including the Corrections component) and the Legal Training Centre. Building on the positive results achieved to date, the new project phase (JSP Phase IV) will systematize and improve mechanisms for policy-making, coordination, and strategic planning. This means more focus on consultative law-making practices, improved planning, management and administration, with a more evidence-based approach. This will be complemented by introducing a new \"district pilot\" approach where innovative solutions for improving the management and access to justice can be tested. This \"district pilot\" approach will target interventions that can contribute to  better administration of criminal justice between agencies and  stakeholders such as the District Prosecutor's Office, National Police (PNTL) and local communities.  On the demand side, innovative approaches will be tested to increasing peoples' awareness of, and ability to access their rights. With a particular focus on the most vulnerable populations, successfully demonstrated innovations and lessons will inform national planning and policy making for wider application scale up or institutionalization.","output_id":"00088880","output_title":"New Phase Justice System Prog."}],"project_descr":"Consolidating the Democratic Rule of Law and Peace through a strong Justice System in Timor-Leste (Revised Justice System Programme)","project_id":"00014955","project_title":"Justice System Programme","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2003-07-17","subnational":[{"awardID":"00014955","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"-8.55861","lon":"125.57361","name":"Dili","outputID":"00014955","output_locID":"00014955-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00014955","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"-8.83333","lon":"125.75","name":"Timor-Leste","outputID":"00088880","output_locID":"00088880-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
