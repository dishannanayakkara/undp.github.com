The Travel Equalization Scheme (TES) aims to equalize the indifferences of financial contribution of the Country Offices when they request BRC services. Distant offices (i.e. Central Asia) are in disadvantage, compared with geographically close offices (i.e. Western CIS). The TES was introduced by BDP several years ago and BRC also implemented this approach. \r\nThe implementation of the TES requires active communication with the COs and also that BRC travelers (policy advisors), requested by the Country Offices to provide support and come to the COs on missions, are well-aware of this scheme. The traveler should inform the office well in advance that the payment modality for the travel expenses are implemented under the TES. The information on the TES supported travel needs to be passed accordingly to the travel department and the project assistants should indicate this information directly in the Atlas requisition. \r\nCountry office will pay charges that include actual DSA + terminals + 1300$ lump sum for the cost of travel. CO has to provide the correct Chart of Accounts for all these elements.\r\n Below are the details that are mostly important for the BRC program assistants, but others are also welcome to review the technical side of the TES, if of any interest.\r\nHow does the scheme work in Atlas? \r\n Travel Department creates Non-PO Voucher to pay the traveler under the following menu:\r\n Accounts Payable>Voucher>Entry>Regular Entry>Add New Value>Enter BU, Date, and Gross Invoice Amount that is going to be paid to traveler (DSA + Terminals). Click ADD.\r\nOnce in the Distribution Line of the created voucher, in the Amount field you will enter the total amount that is going to be charged to the CO (DSA + terminals + 1300$ for the cost of travel). You will also enter the chartfields as provided by the CO. Then you click + sign at the end of this line. \r\nThe system will automatically generate the negative amount (as the difference between the voucher gross amount and the total amount charged to the CO). Please note that the system also copies the chartfields from the above line, so you will have to change it manually to the chartfields of your BU. \r\nOnce the Vendor #2- Travel Agent submits the invoice for this particular travel, you will create the voucher and enter your chartfields where the money received from CO has initially been transferred to.","output_id":"00069332","output_title":"BRC Advisory Services - TES an"},{"award_id":"00056566","budget":[370000.0,577900.0,127066.0,null],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[251140.0,575683.0,113715.0,202328.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011","2010"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Enhanced advisory services for policy support and programme development in the area of Emerging Donors","output_id":"00069330","output_title":"BRC Advisory Services - Emergi"}],"project_descr":"Advisory Services for Policy Support and Programme Development","project_id":"00056566","project_title":"BRC Advisory Services","region_id":"global","start":"2009-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069283","output_locID":"00069283-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069305","output_locID":"00069305-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069306","output_locID":"00069306-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069307","output_locID":"00069307-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069325","output_locID":"00069325-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069329","output_locID":"00069329-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069331","output_locID":"00069331-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069332","output_locID":"00069332-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00056566","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00069330","output_locID":"00069330-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
