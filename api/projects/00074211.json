Given Tanzania's reliance on climate sensitive agriculture, natural resources management and energy, the impacts of climate change that have already been experienced have had negative effects on the nation's productive sectors and infrastructure. This projects aims at strengthening the capacity of the Government of Tanzania to observe, analyse and forecast climate information to enhance their early warning systems and for climate resilient development and adaptation to climate change. National benefits expected from this project will include reduced losses incurred by the national economy from droughts and floods by providing the means to avoid losses from increased climate variability and climate extremes due to climate change.","output_id":"00086724","output_title":"Climate Information and Early"}],"project_descr":"Climate Information & Early Warning Systems in Tanzania.","project_id":"00074211","project_title":"Climate Information & Early Warning Systems in Tanzania","region_id":"RBA","start":"2014-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00074211","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"-6","lon":"35","name":"Tanzania","outputID":"00086724","output_locID":"00086724-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
